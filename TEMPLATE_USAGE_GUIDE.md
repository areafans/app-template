# üìã Template Usage Guide

A comprehensive guide for leveraging this app template effectively for new projects and working with Claude as your coding assistant.

## üöÄ **Template Usage Process**

### **Phase 1: Project Initialization**

#### **Step 1: Clone and Setup**
```bash
# Clone the template
git clone https://github.com/areafans/app-template.git my-new-project
cd my-new-project

# Remove the original git history and start fresh
rm -rf .git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit from app-template"

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

#### **Step 2: Environment Configuration**
```bash
# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Generate required keys
node -e "console.log('ENCRYPTION_KEY=' + require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
node -e "console.log('NEXTAUTH_SECRET=' + require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

#### **Step 3: Basic Customization**
- Update `package.json` (name, description, author)
- Update `README.md` with your project details
- Change app name in `src/app/layout.tsx`
- Update metadata in `src/app/layout.tsx`

### **Phase 2: Core Configuration**

#### **Key Decisions You'll Need to Make:**

1. **Project Identity**
   - App name and branding
   - Domain/URL structure
   - Target audience
   - Value proposition

2. **Authentication Strategy**
   - Which OAuth providers to enable (Google/Apple/both)
   - User registration flow preferences
   - Required vs optional user information
   - Email verification requirements

3. **User Roles & Permissions**
   - Which of the 5 roles you'll actually use:
     - `ADMIN`: Full system access
     - `PARENT`: Parent portal access
     - `CHILD`: Child-specific features
     - `SUPPORTER`: Supporter features
     - `PARTNER`: Partner portal access
   - Custom permissions per role
   - User onboarding flows per role
   - Role assignment strategy

4. **Payment Strategy**
   - Subscription plans and pricing tiers
   - One-time payment types needed
   - Donation configurations
   - Free tier limitations
   - Trial period settings

5. **Database & Infrastructure**
   - Database hosting (local PostgreSQL, Supabase, PlanetScale, etc.)
   - Deployment platform (Vercel, Railway, AWS, etc.)
   - Email service provider (SendGrid, Resend, etc.)
   - File storage solution (if needed)

## ü§î **Questions to Expect When Starting a New Project**

When you start a new project with Claude, here are the types of questions that will help customize the template effectively:

### **Project Scope Questions:**
- "What type of application are you building?" (SaaS, marketplace, social app, etc.)
- "Who are your target users and how do they differ?"
- "What's your core value proposition?"
- "What problem does this solve?"
- "What's your expected timeline and budget?"

### **Technical Requirements:**
- "Do you need real-time features?" (chat, notifications, live updates)
- "What integrations do you need?" (email services, analytics, CRM, etc.)
- "Do you have specific UI/UX requirements or design preferences?"
- "What's your expected scale?" (MVP vs enterprise)
- "Do you need mobile apps or is PWA sufficient?"
- "What compliance requirements do you have?" (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)

### **Business Model Questions:**
- "How will you monetize?" (subscriptions, one-time, freemium, etc.)
- "What payment flows do you need?" (trials, upgrades, downgrades, etc.)
- "Do you need multi-tenancy or organization features?"
- "What analytics and reporting do you need?"
- "Do you need affiliate or referral systems?"

### **User Management:**
- "What user roles make sense for your specific app?"
- "What information do you need to collect from users?"
- "How should user onboarding work?"
- "Do you need user verification processes?"
- "What communication features do users need?"

## üí° **How to Leverage Claude Most Effectively**

### **1. Start with Clear Project Description**

**Best Prompt Format:**
```
"I want to build [type of app] for [target users] that [main purpose]. 
The key features I need are [list]. My business model is [model]. 
I'm using the app-template as my starting point."
```

**Example:**
```
"I want to build a learning management system for small businesses 
that helps them train employees. Key features: course creation, 
progress tracking, certificates, team management. Business model: 
monthly subscriptions per user. Using the app-template as starting point."
```

### **2. Progressive Development Approach**

**Phase 1: Core Customization**
```
"Help me customize the app-template for my [project type]. Let's start by:
1. Updating the user roles to fit my needs
2. Customizing the authentication flow
3. Setting up the basic UI structure"
```

**Phase 2: Feature Development**
```
"Now let's build [specific feature]. Here's what it should do: [requirements]. 
How should this integrate with the existing auth and database structure?"
```

**Phase 3: Advanced Features**
```
"I need to add [complex feature] that involves [technical requirements]. 
What's the best way to implement this with our current architecture?"
```

### **3. Effective Communication Patterns**

#### **DO's:**
- ‚úÖ **Be specific about requirements:** "Users should be able to upload files up to 10MB"
- ‚úÖ **Mention constraints:** "This needs to work on mobile" or "Keep it simple for MVP"
- ‚úÖ **Reference existing code:** "Similar to how notifications work, but for..."
- ‚úÖ **Ask for options:** "What are 2-3 ways we could implement this?"
- ‚úÖ **Provide context:** "This is for a healthcare app, so security is critical"
- ‚úÖ **Share your timeline:** "I need this MVP ready in 2 weeks"

#### **DON'Ts:**
- ‚ùå **Vague requests:** "Make it better" or "Add some features"
- ‚ùå **Assume context memory:** Always provide context about your project
- ‚ùå **Rush architecture decisions:** Discuss trade-offs first
- ‚ùå **Skip planning:** "Just start coding" without requirements
- ‚ùå **Ignore existing patterns:** Request changes that break consistency

### **4. Optimal Workflow Pattern**

#### **For New Features:**
1. **Requirements gathering:** "I need [feature] that does [specific things]"
2. **Architecture discussion:** "How should this fit with our existing structure?"
3. **Implementation planning:** "What's the step-by-step approach?"
4. **Implementation:** "Let's build this component by component"
5. **Testing & refinement:** "Let's test this and handle edge cases"
6. **Documentation:** "Update any relevant documentation"

#### **For Customization:**
1. **Identify what to change:** "The current [X] doesn't fit my needs because [Y]"
2. **Design new approach:** "What's the best way to modify this for [use case]?"
3. **Plan dependencies:** "What other parts of the system will this affect?"
4. **Implement changes:** "Let's update the code to support [new requirement]"
5. **Update related systems:** "What else needs to change to support this?"
6. **Test integration:** "Let's make sure everything still works together"
